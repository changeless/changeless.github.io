# CRISPR: A Bacterial and Archeal Immune System Adapted for Eukaryotic Gene Editing

## Adaptive Immunity in Bacteria and Archea
![CRISPR/Cas9 mediated acquired immunity in prokaryotes](https://wol-prod-cdn.literatumonline.com/cms/attachment/1e47445c-4cfe-456b-8528-13609e98958d/bmb21108-fig-0001-m.jpg)
1. CRISPR: Clustered Regulatory Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats - a defense mechanism in an adaptive immune system (along with the CRISPR‐associated Proteins or Cas proteins)
2. By integrating DNA sequences that are identical to past invaders into their genome, bacteria and archea generate a cellular memory of past invaders. 
3. These acquired sequences allow the bacteria or archea to recognize viral or plasmid invaders as non‐self, resulting in the degradation of the invading sequence and functioning as an adaptive immune system for prokaryotes.
