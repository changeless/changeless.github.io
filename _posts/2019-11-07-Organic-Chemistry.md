# Covalent bonding and shape of molecules
## Electronic structure of atoms
1. Rule 1: The Aufbau (“Build up”) principle: 随核电荷数递增，大多数元素的电中性基态原子的电子按顺序填入核外电子运动轨道 Orbitals fill in order of increasing energy, from lowest to highest
2. Rule 2: The Pauli Exclusion Principle (paired spins): 每个轨道最多两个电子，且自旋相反配对 No more than two electrons may be present in an orbital. If two electrons are present, their spins must be paired 
3. Rule 3: Hund’s Rule: When orbitals of equal energy are available but there are not enough electrons to fill all of them completely, one electron is put in each before a second electron is added to any.

## The concept of energy
1. Ground state基态: the lowest energy state of a system
2. Excited state激发态: a state of a system at higher energy than the ground state
3. First ionization potential: the energy needed to remove the most loosely held electron from an atom or a molecule. 不是基态，就是激发态。

## Lewis dot structure
1. Valence electron: electrons in the valence原子价 (outermost) shell of an atom
2. Lewis dot structure: only valence electron

## Lewis Model of bonding
### Formation of chemical bonds
1. Anion负离子/ Cation正离子: atoms bearing a negative/ positive charge
2. Covalent bond: a chemical bond formed between two atoms by sharing one or more pairs of electrons

### Electronegativity and chemical bond
1. Electronegativity电负性: a measure of the force of an atom’s attraction for electrons 原子对成键电子的吸引能力 (H: 2.1) - 右上MAX；左下MIN
2. Electron affinity电子亲和力: energy added or released when an electron is added to an atom or a molecule

### Formal charge

### Exception to the Octet Rule

## Functional Groups

### Amines (amino)
### Aldehydes and Ketones (carbonyl)
### Carboxylic Acid (carboxyl)
### Carboxylic ester
### Carboxylic Amides 羧酸酰胺 (amid酰胺): CNO

## Bond Angeles and Shapes of Molecules
1.  Valence-shell electron-pair repulsion (VSEPR): a method for predicting bond angles based on the idea that electron pairs repel each other and stay as far apart as possible
2.  Tetrahedral: 四面体 CH4 109.5
3.  Pyramidal: 金字塔 NH3 120
4.  Linear: 180

## Polar and Nonpolar Molecules
The dipole moment of a molecule is the vector sum of its bond dipoles.

## Quantum mechanic (wave mechanics): The branch of science that studies particles and their wavelike properties.

## Resonance 谐振 
### Theory of resonance: 如果一个物质存在两种以上满足共振要求的路易斯结构，这类物质只能用共振式来书写 (曲线箭头)

### Rules of writing acceptable contributing structure
1. Preference 1: filled valence shells
2. Preference 2: Maximum number of covalent bond
3. Preference 3: least separation of unlike charges
4. Preference 4: negative charge on a more electronegative atom
