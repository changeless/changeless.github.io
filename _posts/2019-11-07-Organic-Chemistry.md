# Covalent bonding and shape of molecules
## Electronic structure of atoms
1. Rule 1: The Aufbau (“Build up”) principle: 随核电荷数递增，大多数元素的电中性基态原子的电子按顺序填入核外电子运动轨道 Orbitals fill in order of increasing energy, from lowest to highest
2. Rule 2: The Pauli Exclusion Principle (paired spins): 每个轨道最多两个电子，且自旋相反配对 No more than two electrons may be present in an orbital. If two electrons are present, their spins must be paired 
3. Rule 3: Hund’s Rule: When orbitals of equal energy are available but there are not enough electrons to fill all of them completely, one electron is put in each before a second electron is added to any.

## The concept of energy
1. Ground state基态: the lowest energy state of a system
2. Excited state激发态: a state of a system at higher energy than the ground state
3. First ionization potential: the energy needed to remove the most loosely held electron from an atom or a molecule. 不是基态，就是激发态。
