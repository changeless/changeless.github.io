Isothermal Amplification: a method to detect nucleic acid target sequence in a streamlined, exponential manner, and are not limited by the constraint of thermal cycling.
Principle: without heat denaturing, all isothermal methods rely on an alternative approach to enable primer binding and initiation of the amplification reaction: a polymerase with strand-displacement activity. Once the reaction is initiated, the polymerase must also separate the strand that is still annealed to the sequence of interest. 

Isothermal methods typically employ unique DNA polymerases for separating duplex DNA. 
DNA polymerases with this ability include Klenow exo-, Bsu large fragment, and phi29 for moderate temperature reactions (25–40°C) and the large fragment of Bst DNA polymerase for higher temperature (50–65°C) reactions.
To detect RNA species, a reverse transcriptase compatible with the temperature of the reaction is added (except in the NASBA/TMA reaction) to maintain the isothermal nature of the amplification.

# Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP)
1. Reaction temperature: 65°C
2. Amplicon size: <250 nt
3. DNA product: long, branched
4. Detection methods: Visual, Lateral flow, Gel, Turbidity

LAMP uses 4-6 primers recognizing 6-8 distinct regions of target DNA. A strand-displacing DNA polymerase initiates synthesis and 2 of the primers form loop structures to facilitate subsequent rounds of amplification. LAMP is rapid, sensitive, and amplification is so extensive that the magnesium pyrophosphate produced during the reaction can be seen by eye, making LAMP well-suited for field diagnostics.
