Isothermal Amplification: a method to detect nucleic acid target sequence in a streamlined, exponential manner, and are not limited by the constraint of thermal cycling.
Principle: without heat denaturing, all isothermal methods rely on an alternative approach to enable primer binding and initiation of the amplification reaction: a polymerase with strand-displacement activity. Once the reaction is initiated, the polymerase must also separate the strand that is still annealed to the sequence of interest. 

Isothermal methods typically employ unique DNA polymerases for separating duplex DNA. 
DNA polymerases with this ability include Klenow exo-, Bsu large fragment, and phi29 for moderate temperature reactions (25–40°C) and the large fragment of Bst DNA polymerase for higher temperature (50–65°C) reactions.
To detect RNA species, a reverse transcriptase compatible with the temperature of the reaction is added (except in the NASBA/TMA reaction) to maintain the isothermal nature of the amplification.

# Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP)
1. Reaction temperature: 65°C
2. Amplicon size: <250 nt
3. DNA product: long, branched
4. Detection methods: Visual, Lateral flow, Gel, Turbidity

LAMP uses 4-6 primers recognizing 6-8 distinct regions of target DNA. A strand-displacing DNA polymerase initiates synthesis and 2 of the primers form loop structures to facilitate subsequent rounds of amplification. LAMP is rapid, sensitive, and amplification is so extensive that the magnesium pyrophosphate produced during the reaction can be seen by eye, making LAMP well-suited for field diagnostics.

# Whole Genome Amplification (WGA)
1. Reaction temperature: 30°C
2. Amplicon size: N/A 
3. DNA product: long, branched
4. No specific primer needed

WGA is a method of Multiple Displacement Amplification (MDA) that utilizes the strand-displacement activity of DNA polymerases such as phi29 or Bst DNA Polymerase to enable robust amplification of an entire genome. WGA has become an invaluable approach for utilizing limited samples of precious stock material or to enable sequencing of single-cell genomic DNA. Products of the reaction are extremely long (>30 kb) and highly branched through the multiple displacement mechanism.

# Strand Displacement Amplification (SDA)
1. Reaction temperature: 60°C
2. Amplicon size: <100 nt
3. DNA product: short, discrete
4. Detection Method: Fluorescence

SDA, or a similar approach, Nicking Enzyme Amplification Reaction (NEAR), relies on a strand-displacing DNA polymerase, typically Bst DNA Polymerase, Large Fragment or Klenow Fragment (3’-5’ exo–), to initiate at nicks created by a strand-limited restriction endonuclease or nicking enzyme at a site contained in a primer. The nicking site is regenerated with each polymerase displacement step, resulting in exponential amplification. NEAR is extremely rapid and sensitive, enabling detection of small target amounts in minutes. SDA and NEAR are typically utilized in clinical and biosafety applications.

# Helicase-Dependent Amplification (HDA)
1. Reaction temperature: 65°C
2. Amplicon size: <150 nt
3. DNA product: short, discrete
4. Detection Method: Lateral flow

HDA employs the double-stranded DNA unwinding activity of a helicase to separate strands, enabling primer annealing and extension by a strand-displacing DNA polymerase. Like PCR, this system requires only two primers. HDA has been employed in several diagnostic devices and FDA-approved tests.

# Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA)
1. Reaction temperature: 37°C
2. Amplicon size: <1,000 nt
3. DNA product: short, discrete
4. Detection methods: Fluorescence, Lateral flow

RPA uses a recombinase enzyme to help primers invade double-stranded DNA. T4 UvsX, UvsY, and a single stranded binding protein T4 gp32 form D-loop recombination structures that initiate amplification by a strand-displacing DNA polymerase. RPA is typically performed at ~37 °C and, unlike other methods, can produce discrete amplicons up to 1 kb.

# Nucleic Acid Sequences Based Amplification (NASBA)
1. Reaction temperature: 40-55°C
2. Amplicon size: <150 nt
3. DNA product: short, discrete
4. Fluorescence

NASBA and Transcription Mediated Amplification (TMA) are both isothermal amplification methods that proceed through RNA. Primers are designed to target a region of interest; one of the primers must include the promoter sequence for T7 RNA polymerase at the 5’ end. NASBA and TMA reactions are utilized in a range of clinical diagnostics.
