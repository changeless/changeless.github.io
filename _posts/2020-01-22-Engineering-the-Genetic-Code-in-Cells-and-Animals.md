## Background
1. The genetic code uses 61 codons to specify 20 common amino acids and 3 stop codons for termination in protein translation.
2. This code is preserved in virtually all life forms on earth with minor variations.
3. In recent years, the genetic code has been expanded to encode unnatural amino acids (Uaas) by introducing into live cells a new **tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) pair**, which is **orthogonal** to endogenous tRNA/aaRS pairs
