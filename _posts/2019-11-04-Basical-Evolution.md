# Genetic Variation

## Type
1. Environmental variation.
2. Genetic variations.
3. Continuous variation.
4. Discontinuous variation.

## Causing agent

### Gene mutations

### Crossing over

### Genetic recombinations

### Genetic drift
基因漂变指的是种群中等位基因频率在每一个世代之间的随机的变化。

#### Genetic hitchhiking
Evolution is accompanied by other mutations with no obvious benefit.
1. Selective sweeps happen when newly appeared (and hence still rare) mutations are advantageous and increase in frequency. 
2. Neutral or even slightly deleterious alleles that happen to be close by on the chromosome 'hitchhike' along with the sweep.
3. An allele changes frequency not because it itself is under natural selection, but because it is near another gene that is undergoing a selective sweep and that is on the same DNA chain
4. When one gene goes through a selective sweep, any other nearby polymorphisms that are in linkage disequilibrium will tend to change their allele frequencies too.

### Background selection
Similiar with genetic hitchhiking but in oppsite selection. The loss of genetic diversity at a non-deleterious locus due to negative selection against linked deleterious alleles.

##### Selective sweep
由于某一位点受到强选择后，其周围的位点的多态性因受改位点牵连而发生多态性降低的现象。
A selective sweep is the reduction or elimination of variation among the nucleotides in neighboring DNA of a mutation as the result of recent and strong positive natural selection.

    A1, B1, and C1 are three SNP sites in one haplotype. When A1 is chosen, the frequency of A1B1C1 is increasing. 
    If it's a strong selection, B2/C2 will lose.

#### HGT: horizontal gene transfer

### Gene flow / migration
当种群之间并未受到地理或是文化上的阻碍时，基因变异会经由一些个体的迁移，使基因在不同种群间扩散

### Environmental factors

# Nature selection


5. Effects on a neutral locus due to linkage disequilibrium with newly appeared deleterious mutations are called background selection.
6. Both genetic hitchhiking and background selection are stochastic (random) evolutionary forces, like genetic drift.

# Mendelian inheritance

## Mutation bias
